His two older brothers, Geoffrey and Randy, are mostly disobliging. One night, the three boys are left alone when their mother visits relatives, so they decide to visit a local circus for a night of amusement, despite Casey's uncontrollable coulrophobia. Meanwhile, the local state insane asylum has sent a majority of the hospital's inmates to the carnival for therapy, but three psychotic mental patients break away from the group and kill three clowns, taking their makeup and costumes.\r\nWhile at the circus, Casey innocently visits a fortune teller despite Randy's better judgment. The fortune teller reveals to Casey that his life line has been cut short, and says to him: \"Beware, beware, in the darkest of dark /though the flesh is young and the hearts are strong /precious life cannot be long /when darkest death has left its mark.\"\r\nAs the boys return from the circus, a shaken Casey thinks his nightmare is over, but it has only just begun. When the clowns target their home, Casey is forced to face his fears once and for all. Casey and his brothers are locked inside their isolated farmhouse and the power is turned off. Casey attempts to call the police, but because Casey says that the \"clowns from the circus are trying to get him\", the police officers assume that Casey's fear of clowns caused him to have a realistic nightmare. The officers tell Casey that everything will be fine if he goes back to sleep, and hangs up.\r\nRandy mockingly dresses up as a clown, disbelieving of Casey's claims that clowns are inside the house. His plan to jump out at Geoffrey and Casey is cut short after he is stabbed by one of the clowns. Geoffrey manages to kill the first clown by hitting him with a wooden plank, knocking him down a flight of stairs and breaking his neck.\r\nLater on, after tricking the clown, Casey and Geoffrey push another clown out a window to his death. Casey and Geoffrey find Randy unconscious in a closet and drag him into another room. Geoffrey is then attacked and presumably killed by the final clown, who chases Casey into the upstairs game room. Casey manages to hide for the time being, but after the clown leaves, Casey accidentally steps on a noise-making toy, alerting the clown of his presence. The enraged clown attempts to break Casey's neck, but he is then killed by Geoffrey (who survived the clown's attack), slamming a hatchet into the killer's back, and the two exhausted and traumatized brothers hug each other as the police finally arrive to help them.\r\nThe film ends with this narration:"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Constructing a Prompt for Gemini Query Response\n\nThis code prepares a custom prompt for Gemini by first formatting the user query into a single line.  \nIt defines the assistant's tone and instructions for how to answer, encouraging complete, friendly, and relevant responses.Each retrieved document passage is cleaned and appended to the prompt as context.  \nThe final prompt is printed, ready to be used for generating a contextual response from the model.  \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"query_oneline = query.replace(\"\\n\", \" \")\n\n# This prompt is where you can specify any guidance on tone, or what topics the model should stick to, or avoid.\nprompt = f\"\"\"You are a helpful and informative bot that answers questions using text from the reference passage included below. \nBe sure to respond in a complete sentence, being comprehensive, including all relevant background information. \nstrike a friendly and converstional tone.
